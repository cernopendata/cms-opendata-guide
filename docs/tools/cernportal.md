# The CERN Open Data Portal

All CMS open data is available through [the CERN Open Data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). The portal hosts data from many experiments and offers search options, such as experiment, type or energy of collisions, type of data (from collisions or simulated), and many more. A brief description of [the portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/about) and those of each experiment are available from the "About" dropdown menu top right.

The CERN Open Data portal contains the data records, environment, software and supplementary material to enable research-level use of open data. It also includes some basic documentation and topical guides. For CMS, this Open data guide complements the information available on the portal.

The access to the data records is either through streaming with the XRootD protocol or direct http download. A command-line tool [cernopendata-client](https://cernopendata-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is also available for data download and inspection.
