To learn more follow [this](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) tutorial and get familiar with  the basic commands in Unix Shell. 

In order to follow this guide properly you should learn how to handle basic unix enviroments. While you get familiar with all the command lines, feel free to check a [Unix Cheat Sheet](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/unix_cheatsheet.html) to quickly remember some of them. 

##Commands you will need for this guide

Once you are in your OS terminal, navigate through your directories with the: `cd <directory>` command (short for Change Directory).

Also you can check all the files and other directories in your current location typing the command: `ls`.

Type the flag: `--help` after any of these commands to read all the documentation and the different options you have to use them.

If you want to know your current location, just type: `pwd`.

If you want to create a new directory, type: `mkdir <new_directory>`.

Sometimes you need to rewrite, read or rename a file name and you do not have the right access, to do this you have to be the correct user. If you want to know what user are you, type `whoami`.
