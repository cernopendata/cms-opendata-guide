# CMS Open Data Guide

!!! Warning
    This page is under construction

Welcome to the guide for CMS open data.  This guide is brought to you by the CMS open data group, on a best-effort basis. All software and instructions are provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. This is ongoing work and we appreciate your feedback and/or your help building this guide.

## How to use this site

There are three main tabs to help you navigate the site.  It starts with the **Computing Tools** most likely needed to deal with CMS open data.  Then, there is a little review of **CMSSW**, which is the software used by CMS.  Finally the **Analysis** section guides you through the different steps (in the most general order) that you need to follow for performing a particle physics analysis with CMS open data.

## The site's philosophy

This site is thought as a navigation aid.  The CMS Collaboration has built an extensive amount of documentation over the years.  However, given the nature of our rapidly evolving research activities, this documentation is usually scattered around, which makes it difficult to navigate.  The main goal of this guide, therefore, is to facilitate the usage of CMS open/legacy data by providing a structured set of instructions that agglutinate those pieces of information already available in other sites.  In this sense, we do not pretend to copy every little piece of information and/or code, but to help you get to it and find your way around it.

For CMS open data the three main sources of documentation/information are:

- The CMS public [Twiki pages](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WebHome).  Particularly the [workbook](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBook) and the [software guide](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuide)

    !!! Note
        When accessing the CMS twiki pages we will usually point you to the most recent page.  However, historical Twiki documentation, i.e., earlier revision of the pages, may provide more accurate information for open data that is already a few years old. One can access this historical archive by going to the bottom of any Twiki page, clicking on **History** and exploring the revisions closer to the open data release year.

- The [CERN CMS Open Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/search?experiment=CMS) pages.  This portal is not exactly meant to archive documentation.  It is mainly a repository for our open data.  However, it does host important information that is not so easy to find.  This guide will point you to the right pages.

- The [CMSSW code](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw).  Although less conventional, exploring the CMSSW code could be a really good source of information.  For instance, having hundreds of trigger bits, if the information from a specific module used in a specific trigger (with which data was taken) was needed, it would be impossible to document that explicitly in some guide. Instead, one can explore the code and easily find out the needed information. We will try to show you how it is done.
