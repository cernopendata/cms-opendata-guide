# Luminosity Uncertainty

The number of collisions in CMS is not known with absolute certainty. Calculating the uncertainty in the luminosity value requires precision work, and is documented in the [CMS luminosity papers](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsLUM). The values for proton-proton collisions are:

 - 2011 data: 2.2\%
 - 2012 data: 2.6\%
 - 2015 data: 1.6\%
 - 2016 data: 1.2\%

For heavy-ion data, the uncertainties are:

 - 2013 pPb data: 3.4\% for p-Pb, 3.6\% for Pb-p
 - 2015 pp reference data: 2.3\%
 - 2015 PbPb data: 3.0\%

These uncertainties should be applied to the number of events observed in simulations that are normalized based on the integrated luminsity measurement.
